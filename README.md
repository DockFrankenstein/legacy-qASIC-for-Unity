# Introduction
qASIC i a simple collection of tools to quickly create games in the Unity. Using qASIC makes your games more accesible and easier to create and debug. By using things as: the Input Manager, Options system or in-game Game Console you can add basic things that let users do things that are expected in almost every game, while you focus on your project. If you are making a proper game you want to add ways of changing fullscreen, vsync or resolution and most likely add your own custom options on top of that. Meanwhile if there's a game breaking bug fe. you can just tell users to temporarily type a command in the console, while you try fixing it.

# Tools:
* In Game Console
* Options
* Audio manager
* Input manager
* File Manager
* Custom Config Controller
* Info displayer (displays fps, processor, gpu etc)

# Why should you use it
Having options and remapable inputs makes your game more accesible to other users. Tools such as the console seems like overkill, but it helps to easily debug issues in game, or to quickly test something out. If you don't bother to create your own tools, or you would prefer something more solid qASIC is for you.
