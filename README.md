#### Quick Basics for starting projects fast

## What is qASIC
qASIC is a collection of **tools for debugging and adding basic features**. This includes:
- In game console
- Custom mapable input system
- Customaizable options
- Saving system
- Gloabl audio managment

## Customalization
From console layout, log colors, custom options qASIC gives power to the developer.

## Console
This is the most advanced feature of qASIC. An in-game console for cheating, debugging, or checking errors. 

To add a command it's just as simple as creating a new script from a template. You change the name, description, help message and what it will do. It will automatically be added to the list

You can control specific options with the console config and console theme. If you dislike the build in colors, you can change them for your own liking.

To say something in the console just write qDebug.Log() or qASIC.Console.GameConsoleController.Log(). Now you will know what's not working without having to look deep inside the files.

qASIC console comes with some built in commands such as: echo or help

#Input system
qASIC supports simple remapable bindings. Currently in beta
